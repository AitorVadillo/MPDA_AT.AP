"""A simulation of two virtual chemicals reacting and diffusing on a 2D grid using the Gray-Scott model.
    Inputs:
        Width: Int, Number of cells in width
        Heigth: Int, Number of cells in Heigth
        Run: Boolean, True to initialize the reaction
    Output:
        a: The a output variable"""

"""
Reaction: two Bs convert an A into B, as if B reproduces using A as food.
Some typical values used, for those interested, are: DA=1.0, DB=.5, f=.055, k=.062 (f and k vary for different patterns), and Î”t=1.0. 
The Laplacian is performed with a 3x3 convolution with center weight -1, adjacent neighbors .2, and diagonals .05. 
The grid is initialized with A=1, B=0, and a small area is seeded with B=1.
The grid is visualized by assigning each cell a color from it's A and B values. Here A is white and B is black.
